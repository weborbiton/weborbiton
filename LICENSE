====================================================================
1. GENERAL PROVISIONS AND COPYRIGHT
====================================================================

The WebOrbiton software (“Software”) is provided as "source available"
and is subject to the terms of this License. All copyrights to the
Software (PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, configurations, and other elements),
excluding any third-party libraries or components used,
which are subject to their own respective licenses,
belong to the WebOrbiton Team (“Licensor”).

Definitions:
- Licensee: any person or entity using the Software.
- Commercial Project: Software (original or modified) offered directly 
  as a standalone product, paid SaaS service, subscription tool, or part 
  of an offer whose main value is the Software itself.

The Licensee has the right to modify the code in any way, including:
- changing function names, project structure, or author markings,
- creating own forks and modifications,
- adapting the Software for individual needs.

Attribution (author information) is not required, but it is appreciated.

====================================================================
2. USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN FREE AND COMMERCIAL PROJECTS
====================================================================

The Software may be used in any project, including those generating 
revenue, e.g.:
- donations,
- advertisements,
- sale of products and services,
- hosting,
- online stores,
- paid features or subscriptions within the project,
- affiliations.

Such use DOES NOT require the Licensor's consent as long as the Software 
is not offered directly as a standalone product or paid service/subscription. 
Example: using WebOrbiton as a status page in a service generating revenue 
from ads or other services is allowed without consent.

====================================================================
3. CONDITIONS FOR SOFTWARE OFFERED AS A PAID PRODUCT OR SERVICE
====================================================================

If the Software (original or modified) is offered directly as a standalone 
product, paid service, or subscription, and the gross monthly revenue 
from this activity exceeds 1500 USD (or equivalent in another currency), 
the Licensee is obliged to:

1. Within 60 days of exceeding the limit, submit the project to the Licensor 
   via the form: https://weborbiton.click/commercial.
2. Obtain approval for further commercial use of the Software within 90 days 
   of submission.

Example: if the Licensee offers WebOrbiton as a paid application, subscription, 
or SaaS tool that itself generates revenue exceeding 1500 USD per month, 
submission to the Licensor is required. Using WebOrbiton as a status page in 
a service generating revenue from ads or other services DOES NOT require submission.

The Licensor commits to issuing a decision within 60 days of receiving 
the submission. Lack of consent or refusal obliges the Licensee to cease 
commercial use of the Software or obtain a separate commercial license.

Failure to comply with these rules or continuing activity after refusal 
constitutes a violation of this License.
